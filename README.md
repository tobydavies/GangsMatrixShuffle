# GangsMatrixShuffle

This repo contains code to implement and demonstrate the 'shuffle' method for examining the effectiveness of the London Gangs Matrix.

The approach is primarily outlined via a series of Notebooks:

- [0_Shuffle_Analysis.ipynb](notebooks/0_Shuffle_Analysis.ipynb) provides a demonstration of the core approach, along with key results for the London data.

- [1_Validation.ipynb](notebooks/1_Validation) shows how the approach can be validated by applying it to synthetic data.

- [2_Power_Analysis_Plots.ipynb](notebooks/2_Power_Analysis_Plots.ipynb) produces plots for the accompanying power analysis, as performed within [scripts](scripts).
